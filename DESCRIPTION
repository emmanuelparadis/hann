Description: Builds and optimizes Hopfield artificial neural networks (Hopfield, 1982, <doi:10.1073/pnas.79.8.2554>). One-layer and three-layer models are implemented. The energy of the Hopfield network is minimized with formula from Krotov and Hopfield (2016, <doi:10.48550/ARXIV.1606.01164>). Optimization (supervised learning) is done through a gradient-based method. Classification is done with S3 methods predict(). Parallelization with 'OpenMP' is used if available during compilation.
