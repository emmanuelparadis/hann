		CHANGES IN HANN VERSION 1.1-3


NEW FEATURES

    o The new function combine makes predictions combining several
      neural networks possibly optimized with different classes.

    o The new function tune.hann helps to choose the hyperparameters
      (number of hidden neurons and slope of the activation function).

    o The new function hann is a wrapper for all types of neural
      nets. The new class "hann" has 'secondary' classes "hann1" or
      "hann3". There are several new methods: summary(), plot(),
      coef(), fitted(), str(), and labels().

    o The optimized networks now include an element $fitted with the
      final signals, and an element $labels with the labels of the
      input classes.

    o The new function binarize helps to prepare the binary patterns
      from vectors or matrices of numeric values (e.g., read from
      image files).


BUG FIXES

    o A bug has been fixed in the calculations of gradients of hann3()
      so convergence should be improved (and faster).

    o The internal code used to allocate new memory at each iteration:
      this is fixed.


OTHER CHANGES

    o The internal code of hann3() has been optimised so it should be
      at least twice faster.
