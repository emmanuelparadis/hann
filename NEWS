		CHANGES IN HANN VERSION 1.1-3


BUG FIXES

    o A bug has been fixed in the calculations of gradients of hann3()
      so convergence should be improved (and faster).

    o The internal code used to allocate new memory at each iteration:
      this is fixed.


OTHER CHANGES

    o The internal code of hann3() has been optimised so it should be
      at least twice faster.
