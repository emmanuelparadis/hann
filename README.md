**hann** is a R package for building and optimizing Hopfield-based artificial neural networks. Its implementation was made from scratch with (notably):

* Use of BLAS/LAPACK for most matrix operations.
* All optimizations are coded in C (with efficient use of arrays).
* Some parallel code make use of OpenMP (although this is limited for the moment).
* A gradient-based optimization algorithm is used, as well as a quasi-Newton version (the latter is recommended for small networks only).

Hopfield networks have the property to be able to learn many patterns with a small number of input neurons making possible to build parsimonious neural networks.

## Installation

hann must be compiled in the standard way of R packages. For the moment, there are no pre-compiled packages. A submission to CRAN is planned to happen soon.

It is recommended to have an efficient BLAS/LAPACK library installed on your system (e.g., OpenBLAS).

If OpenMP is available on your system, parallel (multicore) code is compiled. For the moment, this is available only for the function `hann1()`.

## Background

The Hopfield network (Hopfield, 1982) is a type of neural network with
$N$ (input) neurons which are either in state -1 or
in state +1. These states are determined in order to minimize its global
energy level with respect to a list of $K$ "patterns" each of length
$N$.

In practice, the Hopfield network is coupled with other layers neurons
which are themselves connected to $C$ classification (or output) neurons
whose signals identify the patterns. The different layers are connected
through matrices of weights. There are as many layers than there are
weight matrices.[^1]

The $K$ patterns are used to train the network, both to minimize the
energy level of the Hopfield network and to find the parameter values
that minimize the loss function (the discrepancy between the observed
output signals and their expectations under the known classes of the
patterns).

Hopfield networks can "memorize" a large number of patterns. Giving $N$
input neurons, there are $2^N$ possible patterns, for example for $N=$
30, 60, and 100:

```r
> N <- c(30, 60, 100)
> 2^N
[1] 1.073742e+09 1.152922e+18 1.267651e+30
```

Several studies tried to find if a Hopfield network can memorize as many
patterns as these numbers (e.g., Demircigil et al., 2017; KanterÂ and Sompolinsky., 1987). Krotov
and Hopfield (2016) proposed the following formula for the
maximum number of these patterns ($M$):

$$M=\frac{1}{2(2n-3)!!}\times\frac{N^{n-1}}{\ln N},$$

where $n$ is a
parameter of the energy function. For example for the same values of $N$
above and for $n=$ 2, 10, 20, and 30:

```r
> ## double factorial (n!!) that we want vectorized to use with
> ## outer() below
> dfact <- function(n) {
+     ## seq() is not vectorized on its 2nd arg.
+     x <- mapply(seq, from = 1, to = n, by = 2)
+     sapply(x, prod)
+ }
> ## eq. 6 in Krotov & Hopfield (2016)
> funM <- function(N, n)
+     N^(n - 1) / (2 * dfact(2 * n - 3) * log(N))
> n <- c(2, 10, 20, 30)
> o <- outer(N, n, funM)
> dimnames(o) <- list(paste("N =", N), paste("n =", n))
> o
            n = 2       n = 10       n = 20       n = 30
N = 30   4.410212 8.396947e+04 2.083464e+05 2.037472e+03
N = 60   7.327180 3.571403e+07 9.074098e+10 9.086758e+11
N = 100 10.857362 3.150767e+09 1.323940e+15 2.192610e+18
```

## Data Coding

The patterns must be arranged in a matrix where each row represents a
single pattern (so there are $K$ rows). The number of columns of this
matrix is the number of input neurons ($N$).

```r
> N <- 60L
> K <- 2000L
> p <- 0.15 # not smaller than 0.15
> probs <- c(p, 1 - p)
> v <- c(-1L, 1L)
> set.seed(1)
> xi1 <- t(replicate(1000, sample(v, N, TRUE, probs)))
> xi2 <- t(replicate(1000, sample(v, N, TRUE, rev(probs))))
> xi <- rbind(xi1, xi2)
> stopifnot(nrow(unique(xi)) == K)
```

Before simulating the data, we called `set.seed(1)` to repeat
consistently the results each time the code of this vignette is
executed. If the user wants to simulate other data, just delete the line
or give another value to `set.seed()`. If a small value is given to `p`,
it is more likely that the number of unique patterns is less than $K$.
It is recommended to use only unique patterns in the subsequent
analyses.

## Building the Hopfield Network

The function `buildSigma()` finds a network with the lowest energy
level. The algorithm starts from a random network; convergence to a low
energy level depends on the initial state of the network. Thus, the
algorithm is repeated 100 times (by default). For this document, we set
the number of repetitions to 10 to avoid printing to many lines.[^2] We
try the function with two values of the energy parameter: $n=20$ (this
is the default) and $n=30$.

```r
> library(hann)
> sigma20 <- buildSigma(xi, nrep = 10)
 1:  Initial energy = -1.02e+25   Updated energy = -4.05e+29
 2:  Initial energy = -2.42e+26   Updated energy = 0
 3:  Initial energy = -2.00e+26   Updated energy = 0
 4:  Initial energy = -3.84e+29   Updated energy = 0
 5:  Initial energy = -4.87e+25   Updated energy = -3.87e+35
 6:  Initial energy = -2.55e+29   Updated energy = 0
 7:  Initial energy = -1.02e+28   Updated energy = 0
 8:  Initial energy = -4.68e+25   Updated energy = 0
 9:  Initial energy = -5.03e+26   Updated energy = 0
10:  Initial energy = -3.60e+29   Updated energy = 0

Final energy = -3.871808e+35
```

```r
> sigma30 <- buildSigma(xi, n = 30, nrep = 10)
 1:  Initial energy = -5.51e+37   Updated energy = -2.21e+53
 2:  Initial energy = -3.00e+42   Updated energy = 0
 3:  Initial energy = -2.56e+41   Updated energy = 0
 4:  Initial energy = -3.22e+42   Updated energy = -2.21e+53
 5:  Initial energy = -1.18e+39   Updated energy = -3.13e+44
 6:  Initial energy = -5.91e+42   Updated energy = 0
 7:  Initial energy = -2.78e+41   Updated energy = 0
 8:  Initial energy = -6.08e+40   Updated energy = 0
 9:  Initial energy = -8.17e+43   Updated energy = -2.21e+53
10:  Initial energy = -1.18e+47   Updated energy = 0

Final energy = -2.214794e+53
```

Typically, around 20% of the repetitions convergence to the same
(lowest) energy level. It is recommended to leave the default
`nrep = 100`.

## Optimizing the Parameters

The package **hann** has two functions to build neural
networks: `hann1` and `hann3`. See their respective help pages where
they are described.

We now optimize both types of networks with the data simulated above. We
first create a membership variable indicating that the first 1000
patterns belong to the same class, and the last 1000 ones to another
class:

```r
> cl <- rep(1:2, each = 1000)
```

Considering that each pattern in the first class has, on average, 15% of
$-1$, while each pattern in the second class has, on average, 15% of +1,
these patterns are expected to be very similar within a class but very
dissimilar between both classes.

We can now optimize the neural nets asking to print the error rate at
each iteration:

```r
> ctr <- control.hann()
> ctr$trace.error <- TRUE
> nt1 <- hann1(xi, sigma20, cl, control = ctr)
Error rate = 1927 / 2000
INITIALIZATION -- iteration 0   obj_fun = 9499.376132
Gradients done.

iteration 1 obj_fun = 9499.376132   Error rate = 0 / 2000
```

For the more complicated 3-layer network, we set a milder target for the convergence of the loss function:

```r
> ctr$target <- 0.1
> nt3 <- hann3(xi, sigma20, cl, control = ctr)
  Error rate = 1354 / 2000
INITIALIZATION -- iteration 0	obj_fun = 4633.223
gradients done.
  Error rate = 418 / 2000

iteration 1	obj_fun = 2613.790  Error rate = 0 / 2000

iteration 2	obj_fun = 1.178  Error rate = 0 / 2000

iteration 3	obj_fun = 0.004
```

Both networks perform well and the optimization converged quickly.

## Classification and Error Rates

The performance of the classification of a network is assessed with the
(generic) function `predict`; thus, the help page is accessed with
`?predict.hann1` (or `?predict.hann3`). We first assess the error rates
with the training data:

```r
> table(predict(nt1, xi, rawsignal = FALSE), cl)
   cl
       1    2
  1 1000    0
  2    0 1000
> table(predict(nt3, xi, rawsignal = FALSE), cl)
   cl
       1    2
  1 1000    0
  2    0 1000
```

A trivial test is to assess whether similar classifications could be
achieved with random parameters (i.e., unoptimized networks). This can
be done by repeating the above analyses after setting the number of
iterations to zero:[^3]

```r
> ctr$iterlim <- 0
> nt0 <- hann1(xi, sigma20, cl, control = ctr)
Error rate = 1924 / 2000
INITIALIZATION -- iteration 0	obj_fun = 8929.935524
Gradients done.
> table(predict(nt0, xi, rawsignal = FALSE), cl)
   cl
      1   2
  1  43 967
  2 957  33
> nt0b <- hann3(xi, sigma20, cl, control = ctr)
  Error rate = 1845 / 2000
INITIALIZATION -- iteration 0	obj_fun = 5202.224
gradients done.
> table(predict(nt0b, xi, rawsignal = FALSE), cl)
   cl
      1   2
  1 101 898
  2 899 102
```

Clearly, random networks cannot identify our patterns.

We remember that both classes of patterns are fairly homogeneous but
different each others. What if these patterns are totally random while
still in two different classes? We try to assess this question by
setting a small network with $N=30$ and $K=200$ patterns.

```r
> N <- 30
> K <- 200
> xi <- matrix(sample(v, K * N, TRUE), K, N)
```

The rest of the analyses is very similar to the above ones:

```r
> sigma <- buildSigma(xi, quiet = TRUE)
> cl <- rep(1:2, each = 100)
> ctr <- control.hann(iterlim = 1000, quiet = TRUE)
> net1 <- hann1(xi, sigma, cl, control = ctr)
> net3 <- hann3(xi, sigma, cl, control = ctr)
```

We used a larger number of iterations to make sure that the
optimizations reached (if possible) a small value of the loss function.
We can now assess the (final) error rates:

```r
> table(predict(net1, xi, rawsignal = FALSE), cl)
   cl
     1  2
  1 77 34
  2 23 66
> table(predict(net3, xi, rawsignal = FALSE), cl)
   cl
      1   2
  1  99   0
  2   1 100
```

The 3-layer net performed much better than the 1-layer one. Setting
`iterlim` to a larger value can make the 3-layer network reach 0% error.
The literature on neural networks states that networks with no hidden
layer fail to solve some problems even with very small data sets
(Elman, 1990; Krotov and Hopfield, 2016).

## Perspectives

The present document aims to give a quick overview of the possibilities
of **hann**. The package is in its development stage; we see
now the current and (possible) future lines of development.

-   Parallelization: there is an early attempt to use multicore based on
    OMP in `hann1()`. Therefore, this cannot be used together with
    functions from the package **parallel**. On the other
    hand, it is possible to run several optimizations in parallel, for
    instance with `parallel::mclapply()` if the OMP-based
    parallelization is off.

-   Preparing databases for training.
    
-   Initializing parameters for optimization.
